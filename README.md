# Stock-Marker-Prediction-With-MarketSentiment-Macroeconomic-Factor

This project employs machine learning methods to forecast stock prices by merging various data inputs, including historical price records, technical indicators, sentiment analysis derived from news and social media, and macroeconomic metrics. The goal is to develop a reliable predictive model that utilizes extensive data features to achieve accurate stock price predictions.

## Key Features:
### Technical Indicators: 
Utilizes TA-Lib and pandas-ta libraries to compute essential technical indicators such as SMA, EMA, RSI, and MACD.
### Sentiment Analysis: 
Integrates sentiment scores derived from news articles (via NewsAPI), Twitter posts (via Twitter API), and Reddit discussions (via Reddit API) to gauge market sentiment.
### Macroeconomic Data: 
Includes macroeconomic indicators such as GDP from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) and World Bank Open Data to capture broader economic trends.
### Machine Learning Models: 
Implements machine learning models like Random Forests to train and predict stock prices based on the combined dataset of technical, sentiment, and macroeconomic features.

## Tools and Technologies:
Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TA-Lib, pandas-ta, newsapi-python, tweepy, praw, fredapi, wbdata.
